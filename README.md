# DevBox v1

`DevBox` is an automation script I wrote in `Python3.8` to help me work with my projects at Practo

# Functions

1. Switch to project directory and run some command.
2. Open project in editor of choice

# Setup

1. You need `Python3.6`
2. Go to `settings.py.sample` and copy contents to `settings.py`. Now populate the dictionaries accordingly. (Instructions in `.sample` file)

## Optional Setup

I have added an alias so I can easily run the script using a command like `dev`

You can do that using:
`alias dev="python3 <folder-where-you-have-cloned-devbox>/devbox/dev_script.py"`
